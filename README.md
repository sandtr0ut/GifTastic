# GifTastic

## App Description

The GifTastic app is essentially, a semi-customizable GIF-image generator, with the following features/functions:

- Click any of the topic buttons to generate 10 related images.

- The images will appear below, along with selected meta-data like rating, title, etc.

- Click on an image to watch it animate.

- Click again to freeze it.

- If you would like to see some images based on some other topic, just type it into the search box on the right, and a new button will appear that you can use like the others.
